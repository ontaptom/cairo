## 🎤 Talk: Turning Text into Multi-Voice Audiobooks with Gemini

Ever wondered how to turn plain text into an engaging, character-driven audiobook — automatically? 

In this session we'll build a real-world pipeline that uses Gemini to analyze a story, detect who's speaking, and assign fitting synthetic voices to each character. Live demos, practical tips, and a behind-the-scenes look at how AI can become an audiobook director.
